The simulated dataset represents a realistic cloud network scenario with heterogeneous services, limited capacity, QoS constraints, and economic cost modeling.

Traffic demand distributions and temporal variations were designed to reflect real-world behavior observed in modern cloud infrastructures.

The dataset enables systematic evaluation of resource allocation strategies and serves as a reproducible benchmark for analyzing the impact of uncertainty on network performance.
